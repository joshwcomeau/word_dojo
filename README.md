Word Dojo
==========

I'm building a clone of one of my favourite word games, Word Dojo. Found on the Megatouch arcade machine thing, it's a fun game where you string together letters to form words, Ã  la Boggle.

Built primarily as a learning exercise, the game uses React components and the Flux architecture, a combination which has been working splendidly. 

I wrote [a blog post](https://medium.com/@joshuawcomeau/efficient-nested-react-components-dd9347e9b3f3) on some of the things I've learned; I made a few mistakes in it, but there's some solid info in it.
